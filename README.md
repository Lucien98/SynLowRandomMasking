# About
This repository contains parsing results of masked S-boxes in [Low_Random_Masking](https://github.com/Chair-for-Security-Engineering/Low_Random_Masking)<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup> using the Verilog Parser of SILVER.

The generated netlist files, with a suffix `.nl`, are located at `unflattened` folder.

`LED` Algorithm uses the S-box of PRESENT. So the folder `LED` contains masked S-boxes of PRESENT.
